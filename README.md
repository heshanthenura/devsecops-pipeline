# DevSecOps Pipeline

This project demonstrates a DevSecOps pipeline built for my demo application, emphasizing security at every stage of the CI/CD process, including static code analysis, dependency scanning, container security, and compliance checks.

## Why I Did This Project

I created this project to understand and demonstrate how security integrates into modern CI/CD pipelines.
My goal was to learn how DevSecOps ensures code quality, secure delivery, and continuous monitoring in real-world software development.
It also helps me practice using tools like SonarQube, Trivy and GitHub Actions for automation.

## Tech Stack

- Application Framework: Flask (Python)

- Containerization: Docker

- CI/CD Platform: GitHub Actions

- Security Tools:

  - SonarQube – Static code analysis

  - Trivy – Container and dependency vulnerability scanning

  - Bandit – Python security linter

- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana (future plan)
